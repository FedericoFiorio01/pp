Data: Renewable Energy Community (REC) energy management https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2022.108590
The dataset reports data of the prosumersâ€™ (producers+consumers) energy dynamics for a period of 1 year.
The consumption related to 50 households and 1 public building is reported, separated for each consumer and for different appliances.
The energy production is reported for the entire REC, consisting in 15 photovoltaic panels.
The REC is provided with a fuel cell to store the electricity charge or to provide power, and the buying/selling to the grid happens with a different pricing depending on the time of the day.
 
Task:
to develop a deep learning application to deal with the
prediction of energy consumption and photovoltaic generation of the entire Renewable Energy Community (REC), exploiting a Federated Learning approach for the prediction of the photovoltaic production.
To exploit the above mentioned predictions to develop an optimal strategy for battery management using Reinforcement Learning in order to maximize the economical reward achieved buying energy from the provider or by selling the photovoltaic-produced energy to the grid.
Data from the 1st half of the year can be used to train the predictive models, and data from the 2nd half of the year can be used to evaluate the performance.
